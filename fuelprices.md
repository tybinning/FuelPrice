# Fuel Prices

## Intro
This roject was started as for personal budget allocation towards gasoline.
The goal is to create a "useful" model that accurately predicts fuel prices for better decision making. 
This may be used possibly for futures contracts on fuel?

### Why is This Important?
Determining fuel costs can lead to large savings if able to store it, or buy futures. 
This can lead to price gains. 

## Workflow

### Create Basic SARMAX
- Practice SARMAX use with generic fuel price data for a simple start
- determine overall seasonality and attempt to explain residuals

### Incorporate Easilty Accessible Exogenious Variables

### Determine How to Use Weather Data?
